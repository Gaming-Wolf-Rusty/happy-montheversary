  <p class="potato" style="width: 80%; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Bruno Fernandes is known for being Miriams' most favourite ManU player currently (there isn't much competition tbh)<br>
    Bruno married his high school sweetheart Anna she believed in him way before the world noticed him.<br>
    their story is a real life Disney love movie. <br>
    you are the main reason I have faith in high school relationships.
