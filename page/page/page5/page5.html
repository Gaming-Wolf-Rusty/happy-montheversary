  <p>Gerrard is known for loyalty, long rage screamers and one unfortunate slip (fuck Liverpool they deserve it). <br>
  His love also started from the teenage years, which I find very beautiful. <br>
  Like Gerrard, I might not always stay on my feet, but I'll never slip when it comes to loving you hehe (look it up;)</p>
