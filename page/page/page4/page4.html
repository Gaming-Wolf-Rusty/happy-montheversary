  <p>Kroos is known for passing the ball like a German laser printer, accurate and clean. <br>
  Toni and Jessica are by far the chillest football ever, bros are always vibing. <br>
  See I can't promise that we will be that chill ngl but currently working on it, no drama from my side (you can, tho I
  can't, that's it).</p>
