  <p>If footballers wrote poetry, it'd sound like Mata ( you can tell when it's a ManU player from the way I talk about
  them). <br>
  Mate was caught writing a love letter for his wife that no one knew about in Madrid before a super important match. <br>
  Just like Mata, nothing will be more important than you in my life, no football, no nothing.</p>
