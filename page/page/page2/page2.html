  <p>Lampard is known for scoring goals like a striker, although he is a midfielder. That's why he is always compared to
  Miriam. <br>
  Frank met his wife during one of the toughest chapters in his life (also similar to me, what can I say), and their love
  is what turned things around for him, just like what you did for me. <br>
  I will spend every second of my life thanking God for subbing you in my life, and I promise I'll be in the startup
  line-up always.</p>
